# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to Wallet (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at [hello@sisheng.my](mailto:hello@sisheng.my).

When you use our App, you trust us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy policy, we seek to explain in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it. We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it is important. If there are any terms in this privacy policy that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our App and our services.

This privacy policy applies to all information collected through our App, and/or any related services, sales, marketing, or events (we refer to them collectively in this privacy policy as the "Services").

## Information We Collect

### Personal Information You Disclose to Us

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the App, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, when participating in activities on the App, or otherwise contacting us.

The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the App, the choices you make, and the features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:

- **Personal Information Provided by You**\
  We collect names, email addresses, and other similar information.
- **Login Data**\
  We provide you with the option to register using your email or Google account.

### Automatically Collected Information

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the App. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our App, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

## How We Use Your Information

We use personal information collected via our App for a variety of business purposes described below. We process your personal information for these purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our legal obligations. We indicate the specific processing grounds we rely on next to each purpose listed below:

- **To Facilitate Account Creation and Login Process**\
  If you choose to link your account with us to a third-party account (such as your Google account), we use the information you allowed us to collect from those third parties to facilitate account creation and login process.
- **To Send Administrative Information to You**\
  We may use your personal information to send you product, service, and new feature information and/or information about changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.
- **To Fulfill and Manage Your Transactions**\
  We may use your information to fulfill and manage your expense entries and related transactions made through the App.
- **To Provide and Improve Our Services**\
  We may use your information to understand how our users utilize the App and to improve the App's functionality and user experience.
- **To Protect Our Services**\
  We may use your information as part of our efforts to keep our App safe and secure (for example, for fraud monitoring and prevention).

## Sharing Your Information

We only share and disclose your information in the following situations:

- **Compliance with Laws**\
  We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
- **Vital Interests and Legal Rights**\
  We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
- **Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers**\
  We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology on the App, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the App over time. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, pages, or features, and better understand online activity.
- **Business Transfers**\
  We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
- **With Your Consent**\
  We may disclose your personal information for any other purpose with your consent.

## Data Retention

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than [time period].

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## Security of Your Information

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.

## Your Privacy Rights

In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right:

- To request access and obtain a copy of your personal information.
- To request rectification or erasure.
- To restrict the processing of your personal information.
- To data portability if applicable.

In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

## Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the App, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the App. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at [hello@sisheng.my](mailto:hello@sisheng.my).

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
